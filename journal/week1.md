# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

## homwork

### Containerize Application

#### backend-flask
i edited the dockerfile to leverage multi-stage builds. This has allowed me slim down the image size from 129 MB to 122 MB (image for proof)

running container:

#### frontend
as a DevOps engineer who has done this at work, i builf the reactjs app and set it up to be served via nginx. I have also leveraged multi-stage builds to slim down the size of this image. The configuration file for nginx used in the Dockerfikle can be found under the directory. note that since this is being served thru nginx the port of the container is 80.

#### docker-compose

as you can see running docker compose with my own fancy nginx image did not work and gave me the following error:

so i defaulted to the dockerfile provided in this bootcamp. I kept my own "fancy" dockerfile and will try to makw it work at some point in the future.

## Homework Challenges
- Run the dockerfile CMD as an external script
- Push and tag a image to DockerHub (they have a free tier)
- Use multi-stage building for a Dockerfile build  
i have done this. look under the homework section for proof and at the Dockerfiles in my repo
- Implement a healthcheck in the V3 Docker compose file
- Research best practices of Dockerfiles and attempt to implement it in your Dockerfile
- Learn how to install Docker on your localmachine and get the same containers running outside of Gitpod / Codespaces
- Launch an EC2 instance that has docker installed, and pull a container to demonstrate you can run your own docker processes.
